This project is made for my YouTube tutorial on "Create Electron Todos App with ReactJS and Laravel API"

## get it up and running.

After you clone this project, do the following:

```bash
# go into the project
cd electron-react-app

# install npm dependencies
npm install

# run create-react-app `webpack-dev-server`
npm start

# open another tab and run electron
npm run electron
```

to create an executable DMG file
```
npm run dist

# Then checkout your dist/ to see the .dmg file
```

Good Luck :)
